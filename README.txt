Run Jaccard_similarity_script_for_ICA_template_comparison.m in Matlab to assess the overlap between each template in a folder and each result in a different folder.

Variables to define within the script - 

template_folder = This should be the directory of the folder containing all template files
results_folder = This should be the directory of the folder containing all results images


The rest of the files within this repository are the ICA components that are the results of the analysis in A Network-level Test of the Role of the Co-activated Default Mode Network in Episodic Recall and Social Cognition (Rebecca L Jackson, Gina F Humphreys, Grace E Rice, Richard J Binney, Matthew A Lambon Ralph), Cortex, 2023. Those labelled 'epi' are from the episodic task. Those labelled 'HCP' are from the social theory of mind task in the Human Connectome Project. Those labelled 'social' only are from the social semantic task from Rice et al. The number of the component is the same used to label the components in the paper. All components are thresholded using cluster correction.
